<![CDATA[ <p>Vector Marketing is currently interviewing for part-time sales reps. Request a virtual interview today and start work within the week!</p><p><strong>What does the part time position involve?<br></strong>Basic responsibilities involve working with customers virtually, explaining our American made Cutco products, and placing any orders. There is a great starting base pay (paid weekly) that isn't based on sales or results, but incentives are possible based on performance. Previous experience isn't needed. We provide all of the training needed for success.</p><p><strong>Excellent pay </strong>- There is a base pay ($26.25 base-appt) that is not based on sales or results. We have a commission structure set up based on performance. There is an opportunity to make more, but there is still a fallback for the sales rep to make an income even if they have an off week.</p><p><strong>Solid training</strong> - We've been training people to do well for over 40 years. Even if someone doesn't decide to stay with us long term, the sales, networking, communication skills they build are needed for any field.</p><p><strong>Flexible scheduling</strong> - We help our reps create a schedule that works best for them. Some work as much as possible, some work part time, while others choose to earn extra income around other commitments such as classes, other jobs, or family obligations. Seasonal work is available for those who are only looking for holiday work.</p><p><strong>Choice of location -</strong> Sales reps work from home and locally after training. Most meetings and training are held in the office.</p><p><strong>What are the requirements?</strong></p><ul><li>Enjoy working with people</li><li>All ages eighteen plus or seventeen and a high school graduate</li><li>Conditions apply</li><li>Able to start within the next 7 - 10 days</li><li>Willing to learn and apply new skills.</li></ul><p><strong>Who would do well in the position?<br></strong>People who have done well with us in the past have had experience in all kinds of fields (some none at all!) - retail, fast food, cashier, administrative assistant, receptionist, office work, server, landscaping, and in just about any field you can imagine. We welcome all applicants who have a positive attitude and enjoy working with people.<br><br>If you think you would be a great fit for our sales team fill out the contact information and a receptionist will follow up with you about setting up a virtual interview with a manager. We encourage applicants of all ages and experience, as we do not discriminate on the basis of an applicant's age.</p> ]]>
